                    <p>Kalpana Chawla (March 17, 1962 - February 1, 2003) was born in Karnal, India. She was the first Indian - American astronaut and first Indian woman in space. She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator. In 2003, Kalpana Chawla was one of the seven crew members killed in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.</p>

            <div class="py-4">
                <p>Born in the Indian city of Karnal in 1962, Chawla was the youngest of four siblings. Being confident and outgoing as she was known to be, she is said to have chosen her own name. At the time of her admission to a nearby school, she had not been given a formal name and was called by her nickname, Monto at home. As the principal asked Chawla to pick a name amongst the three names her family had in mindâ€”Kalpana, Jyotsna and Sunaina. She happened to confidently pick 'Kalpana'. <br> Her interest in aeroplanes and flying had taken roots since her early childhood. Karnal, being one of the few Indian towns at the time to have a flying club, would often see planes flying over, which Chawla had come to notice and enjoy watching. She was taken on a ride on the Pushpak and a glider by her father, an experience she fondly remembered.</p>

            <p>Kalpana Chawla completed her earlier schooling at Tagore Baal Niketan Sr. Sec. School, Karnal. She completed Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering at Punjab Engineering College at Chandigarh in 1982. She moved to the United States in 1982 and obtained a M.S. degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984. Kalpana Chawla went on to earn a second M.S. degree in 1986 and a PhD in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University of Colorado at Boulder. Later that year she began working at the NASA Ames Research Center as vice president of Overset Methods, Inc. where she did CFD research on Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing concepts. Kalpana Chawla held a Certificated Flight Instructor rating for airplanes, gliders and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes and gliders.</p>

                <p>On 2 December 1983, Kalpana Chawla was married to Jean-Pierre Harrison at the age of 21.[16] After the Columbia disaster, Harrison was approached by filmmakers to make a movie on Chawla's life, but he refused because he prefers to keep their life private.</p>

            <h3 class="title1 text-center font-weight-bold">PROFESSIONAL LIFE</h3>
            <p>Kalpana Chawla joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in March 1995 and was selected for her first flight in 1996. She spoke the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space,"You are just your intelligence". She had traveled 10.67 million km, as many as 252 times around the Earth.<br><br>
Her first space mission began on November 19, 1997 as part of the six-astronaut crew that flew the Space Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87. Kalpana Chawla was the first Indian-born woman and the second Indian person to fly in space, following cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma who flew in 1984 in a spacecraft. On her first mission, Chawla traveled over 10.4 million miles in 252 orbits of the earth, logging more than 372 hours in space. During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying the Spartan Satellite which malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Takao Doi to capture the satellite. A five-month NASA investigation fully exonerated Kalpana Chawla by identifying errors in software interfaces and the defined procedures of flight crew and ground control.<br><br>
After the completion of STS-87 post-flight activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the astronaut office to work on the space station, her performance in which was recognized with a special award from her peers.<br><br>
In 2000 she was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of STS-107. This mission was repeatedly delayed due to scheduling conflicts and technical problems such as the July 2002 discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners. On January 16, 2003, Chawla finally returned to space aboard Columbia on the ill-fated STS-107 mission. Chawla's responsibilities included the microgravity experiments, for which the crew conducted nearly 80 experiments studying earth and space science, advanced technology development, and astronaut health and safety.</p>
